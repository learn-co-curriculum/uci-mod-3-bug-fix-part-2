# Bug Fix Lab (Part II)

## Learning Goals

- Recognize correctness of code as a programming goal
- Recognize readability of code is a programming goal

## Introduction

The following statements might seem strange, but they are true:

- Correct code can still be _bad_.
- Incorrect code can be _well-written_
- Sometimes _well-written_ but _incorrect_ code is _better_ code than _correct_
  code

As a programmer, we have to try to create code that is both _correct_ **and**
_well-written_.

### Broken and Hard to Read

Code that's hard to read **and** incorrect is the worst. That's what we saw in
Part 1:

```ruby
class TotalCostCalculator
  attr_reader :description, :cost

  def initialize(description="A sun-drenched paradise", cost=325000, rate=0.02, mortgage_years)
    @description = description
    @cost = cost
    @rate = rate
    @term = 12 * mortgage_years
  end

  def total_loan_cost
    @tlc ||= ((@rate * cost) / 1 - (1 + @rate) ** ( -1 * @term) ) * @term
  end
end

calc = TotalCostCalculator.new("A paradise in Barbados", 250000, 6.5, 5)
puts calc.total_loan_cost
```

This code is not easy to debug. While you might get lucky and see the
problem instantly, most reasonable programmers find `total_loan_cost`'s
logic difficult to reason about. To fix the bug, the implementation of
`total_loan_cost` should look like:

```ruby
    @tlc ||= ((@rate / 100 / 12 * @cost) / (1 - ( 1 + (@rate  / 100 / 12) )**( @term  * -1)) ) * @term
```

The `@rate` variable needs to be divided by 100 (to get a decimal) and then
_again_ by the number of months in a year. But even here, the _correct_ code
is still really un-fun to read.

This code is now no longer _broken_, but it is not _good code_. It's _correct_
but it's not maintainable or readable. It's hard to talk about and verify the
sub-calculations in the `total_loan_cost` calculation. We do the `@rate / 100 / 12` calculation several times. Determining the order of operations isn't exactly
friendly here either. All these bits of friction add up to code that's hard to
work with: bad code.

### Apply the On-Call Developer Test

Many developers of production systems have to do "on-call" rotations.

Imagine this code is on a production system. You've been paged for emergency
support on a holiday. It's 2 a.m. You have enough signal and battery in your
laptop and phone for one change to this file to fix the bug and save the day.
Do you think you can do the **one** edit required to make this code work?

Most programmers would not have a high confidence level &mdash; even those who
have been writing code for decades!

## Broken and Easy to Read

Let's explore what things might have been like if we'd been given
more-clearly-written, but _incorrect_ code.

```ruby
class MortgageCalculator
  attr_reader :description, :cost

  def initialize(description="A sun-drenched paradise", cost=325000, rate=0.02, mortgage_years)
    @description = description
    @cost = cost
    @rate = rate
    @mortgage_years = mortgage_years
  end

  def total_loan_cost
    numerator / denominator * mortgage_months
  end

  private

  def numerator
    @rate * @cost
  end

  def denominator
    1 - ( 1 + @rate )**( mortgage_months * -1)
  end

  def mortgage_months
    @mortgage_years * 12
  end
end

x = MortgageCalculator.new("A paradise in Barbados", 250000, 6.5, 5)
p x.total_loan_cost #=> 97500000.0
```

Using a process (which we'll cover in another lesson) we can see that the
inputs to `total_loan_cost` are `numerator`, `denominator` and,
`mortgage_months`.

Let's validate our inputs. We'll start with the first input, `numerator`. The
code says that we're going to multiply the `@cost` of the property by a
`@rate`, a fraction.

Before we print out that value (or use a debugging tool to stop execution),
let's think about what we _expect_ the return value to be.

- What do you expect `numerator` to look like?
- Is it a `Float` or an `Integer`? It should be a rate, so it should be a `Float`.
- Is it big? Small? It should be smaller than the `@cost` since a decimal
  multiplied by a whole number should be less than the original.

Let's use `p` to print out `numerator`'s value and test our hypothesis.

```ruby
class MortgageCalculator
  attr_reader :description, :cost

  def initialize(description="A sun-drenched paradise", cost=325000, rate=0.02, mortgage_years)
    @description = description
    @cost = cost
    @rate = rate
    @mortgage_years = mortgage_years
  end

  def total_loan_cost
    numerator / denominator * mortgage_months
  end

  private

  def numerator
    p @rate * @cost
  end

  def denominator
    1 - ( 1 + @rate )**( mortgage_months * -1)
  end

  def mortgage_months
    @mortgage_years * 12
  end
end

x = MortgageCalculator.new("A paradise in Barbados", 250000, 6.5, 5)
p x.total_loan_cost #=> 97500000.0
```

The output is:

```text
1,625,000.0 <==== (arrow and commas added for readability)
97500000.0
 => 97500000.0
```

Wait a second! This does **not** match our expectations! We're way off! Our bug
_has_ to be here. If we review the given formula, we see that the expectation
is that the rate is expressed as a percentage, converted to decimal, divided by
the 12 months of the year.

Debugging and fixing well-structured, well-written code is clear. To correct
it is simple and makes simple code even simpler. We'll change the `@rate`
instance variable to be divided by `(100 * 12)` from the very start. We'll
also change the variable name so that it's even clearer that we're talking
about a rate per month.

...Oh yeah, we should also remove our debugging `p` statement, too :)

## Correct and Easy to Read

Here's code that's both _correct_ and _well-structured_.

```ruby
class MortgageCalculator
  attr_reader :description, :cost

  def initialize(description="A sun-drenched paradise", cost=325000, rate=0.02, mortgage_years)
    @description = description
    @cost = cost
    @int_rate_decimal_per_month = rate / 100 / 12
    @mortgage_years = mortgage_years
  end

  def total_loan_cost
    numerator / denominator * mortgage_months
  end

  private

  def numerator
    @int_rate_decimal_per_month * @cost
  end

  def denominator
    1 - ( 1 + @int_rate_decimal_per_month )**( mortgage_months * -1)
  end

  def mortgage_months
    @mortgage_years * 12
  end
end

x = MortgageCalculator.new("A paradise in Barbados", 250000, 6.5, 5)
p x.total_loan_cost #=> 293492.22328093013
```

## The Big Picture

> As students in Mod 1 we should be writing code that is easy to maintain,
> easy to communicate about, and easy reason about **while also** being correct.

Many beginners mistakenly believe that "getting the answer right" is the goal
programming. Getting the right answer with a code that's intelligble to other
humans, including your future self, is the goal.

## Conclusion

The remainder of this module is designed to help you:

- Write maintainable, readable code that is correct
- Debug code with a repeatable process
- Build confidence with core programming data structures and methods (`Arrays` and `Hash`es and `Enumerables`)
- Practice your new approach with challenging labs
